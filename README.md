# wacky-breakout-increment-2
An optional project of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description
Project Description

For this project, you're continuing your work on your Wacky Breakout game.

This project is the second increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll add the following functionality:

    Let the player destroy blocks by hitting them with the ball

    The game will automatically build 3 rows of standard blocks

    Balls that disappear after their lifetime expires and balls that leave the screen are destroyed and replaced with a new ball

    Newly-spawned balls (and the original ball) will delay for approximately 1 second before they start moving

    In addition to replacing balls that expired or left the screen, new balls will be spawned randomly every 5 to 10 seconds
    
Specifically, your solution needs to meet the requirements listed in the Project Description above.

Testing Your Game

Here are some rubrics you can use to confirm that the game functions correctly:

    Row of blocks is provided in the game, with the ball destroying blocks it hits

    Balls disappear after a reasonable period of time and are replaced with a new ball

    When a ball leaves the bottom of the screen it's replaced with a new ball

    New balls are spawned every 5-10 seconds (in addition to the replacement balls from criteria 2 and 3) and newly-spawned balls delay approximately 1 second before starting to move
